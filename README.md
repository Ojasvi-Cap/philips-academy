Bionic arm

Further Steps(Prority Can be changed):
1. Fix I2C Unit Tests(Mock Class already present commented in the test file)
2. The Project can be extended with the Google Proto Buff for cmd line, UART, USB interface.
3. Make Driver for I2C interface with STM32.
4. Look for Sensory Feedback SYstem for Prothetic Arms and order off the shelf sensors to use feedback from arm muscles to move the fingers.
